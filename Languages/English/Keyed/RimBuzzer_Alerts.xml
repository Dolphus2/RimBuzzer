  <UPTT_TrackerAlert_tooltip>UPT stands for UnPaused Time.

This alert measures how long the game has been unpaused for in real time. There is no distinction between different game-speeds other non paused.

The timer begins when you start a new game, load a save or join a multiplayer session; and ends when you Quit to OS, Quit to Main Menu, or leave a multiplayer session.

Hosting a new multiplayer session or converting a multiplayer world back to singleplayer does not reset the timer.
