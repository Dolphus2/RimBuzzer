  <UPTT_TrackerAlert_descr>UPT stands for UnPaused Timer.

It measures how how long the game has been unpaused for in real time. There is no distinction between different game-speeds other non paused.

The timer begins when you start a new game, load a save or join a multiplayer session; and ends when you Quit to OS, Quit to Main Menu, or leave a multiplayer session.

Hosting a new multiplayer session or converting a multiplayer world back to singleplayer does not reset the session.

This timer tells you how much time you have spent in this session.

You may want to avoid playing long sessions of RimWorld.</UPTT_TrackerAlert_descr>
